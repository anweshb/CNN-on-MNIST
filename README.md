# CNN-on-MNIST

The MNIST dataset is a very popular dataset for people starting
to work on CNNs. It is a database of handwritten digits, having a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples 
It comes with Keras's default collection of datasets and can also be found on http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
